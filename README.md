Here is our attempt to make it easier to usefully share ongoing digital humanities projects like dissertations where consulting more experienced folks might help.

One option would be to move the dissertations or their parts to github and organize them so that they could be easily accessed and commented on. A combination of issues + highlighting (hypothes_is?) might work. All repos could state their main goals and current struggles in the main README.md. Maybe link to further subfolders.

Maybe first step is to collect various materials that could help find something like best practices to make a project.
